Kid Cudi's second studio album, Man On The Moon 2: The Legend Of Mr. Rager, was released in 2010 as a follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut, Man On The Moon: The End Of Day. The album features a darker and more experimental sound than its predecessor, exploring themes of addiction, depression, loneliness and fame. The deluxe edition zip file includes four bonus tracks and a digital booklet.
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Cudi's creativity and honesty, but criticized his singing, production and songwriting. Some fans also felt that the album was too gloomy and lacked the catchy hooks and melodies of his first album. However, the album was a commercial success, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and selling over 500,000 copies in the US. It also spawned several singles, such as "Erase Me", "Mr. Rager", "Marijuana" and "Mojo So Dope".

Man On The Moon 2: The Legend Of Mr. Rager is a personal and introspective album that showcases Kid Cudi's struggles with fame, drugs and mental health. The album is divided into five acts, each representing a different stage of Cudi's journey. The first act, "The World I Am Ruling", introduces Cudi as a confident and successful rapper who enjoys the perks of his lifestyle. The second act, "A Stronger Trip", depicts Cudi's descent into drug abuse and paranoia, as he tries to escape his inner demons. The third act, "Party On", portrays Cudi's reckless and hedonistic behavior, as he indulges in sex, alcohol and marijuana. The fourth act, "The Transformation", reveals Cudi's realization that he needs to change his ways and find a better path. The fifth act, "You Live & You Learn", concludes the album with Cudi's acceptance of his flaws and his hope for the future.
 
The album features a variety of musical influences and genres, ranging from rock, pop, soul, electro and indie to psychedelic, ambient, industrial and hardcore. The album also features guest appearances from several artists, such as Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, CeeLo Green, Cage, St. Vincent and more. The album's production is handled by several producers, such as Emile Haynie, Plain Pat, No I.D., Dot da Genius and more. The album's cover art is designed by KAWS, a famous artist and designer who also created the cover art for Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak.
 
Man On The Moon 2: The Legend Of Mr. Rager is a bold and ambitious album that showcases Kid Cudi's artistic vision and emotional depth. The album is not for everyone, as it can be dark, depressing and challenging to listen to. However, for those who appreciate Cudi's honesty and creativity, the album is a rewarding and cathartic experience that reveals the man behind the moon.
